Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js: If you don’t have it installed, download it from https://nodejs.org/.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facebook-landing-page.git
```

### Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS
In the project directory, run the following command to install Tailwind CSS via npm:

```bash
cd facebook-landing-page
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init
```

This will install Tailwind CSS along with PostCSS and Autoprefixer, and create a `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Step 3: Configure Tailwind in Your CSS
Create a `styles.css` file in the `src` folder and include the following code to apply Tailwind's default styles:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Step 4: Build Tailwind CSS
In your `package.json` file, add the following script to build your CSS:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./dist/styles.css --watch"
}
```

Run the build process:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist/styles.css` file, which you can link to in your HTML.

### Step 5: Link Tailwind CSS to HTML
In your `index.html`, link the generated Tailwind CSS file:

```html
<link href="/dist/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Now your project is set up with Tailwind CSS!

Benefits of Using Tailwind CSS

- Utility-First Approach: Tailwind CSS allows you to build custom designs quickly by combining utility classes. 
  This approach eliminates the need to write custom CSS for each component, making development faster and more efficient.
  
- Responsive Design: Tailwind comes with built-in responsive design utilities. 
  This makes creating mobile-first designs easy by using Tailwind’s responsive classes that adapt based on screen size.
  
- Customizable: Tailwind is highly customizable. You can tweak the configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) to fit your project's specific needs, such as customizing colors, spacing, fonts, and more.

- Faster Development: Since you use utility classes directly in the HTML, you can design and implement layouts without writing any custom CSS. 
  This results in faster development time.

- Cleaner Code: With Tailwind CSS, there’s no need for extra custom styles. The utility-first approach leads to cleaner code that’s easier to maintain and understand.
